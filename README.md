You need to have [Redis](https://redis.io/) server on your machine for code to work properly.

To run this app in development mode execute the following commands in root folder

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

in /client folder

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Production mode

Go to /client folder and run

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

And then in the root folder run

The website will be served by Express on 5000 port, no need to start frontend separetly.

## Additional info

Due to size, goal and time constraints of the project many additional security things were omitted - such as
3rd party service secure logins (ex: Auth0), all CORS routes were made accessible.

The repository will be updated with proper links and info when the project will be dockerized and deployed.
